# My Personal Website

A website to display my skills, technologies and projects.

This website was coded using HTML, Sass, and Vuejs.
This was my first project using Vue.js. If you feel that I can improve my code somehow, feel free to let me know. I always accept criticsm.

### Todo ###
 1. Figure out routing for 404.vue
 2. Fix project card centering bug
 3. Get a legit image of myself (this may be the biggest hurdle yet)
